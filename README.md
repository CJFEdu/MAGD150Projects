A collection of p5js sketches created for MAGD 150 in the Fall of 2021.

## Project 1

A simple sketch in greyscale using shapes to draw a building.

## Project 2
### Color Composition  

**Theme:** Planets / Outer Space  
**[Project Link](https://cjfedu.github.io/MAGD150Projects/f21magd150lab02/)**  

A simple sketch adding color to the shapes in order to draw a space scene.

## Project 3
### Math  

**Theme:** Bubbles  
**[Project Link](https://cjfedu.github.io/MAGD150Projects/f21magd150lab03/)**  

This sketch added motion and viewer interaction. 
Clicking on the screen causes the black ball in the center to move toward the mouse click. 
If the ball hits a white "bubble", the bubble disappears.

## Project 4
### Dynamism  

**Theme:** Pizza  
**[Project Link](https://cjfedu.github.io/MAGD150Projects/f21magd150lab04/)**  

This sketch expands on the previous Bubbles sketch. Here "pizza" crusts fall from the top of the sketch. 
The viewer can click on the crusts to add "toppings".  Using the number keys 1 and 2 switches between the red and white toppings.

## Project 5
### Intersections  

**Theme:** Television  
**[Project Link](https://cjfedu.github.io/MAGD150Projects/f21magd150lab05/)**   

This is just a simple television sketch.  Clicking on the ON button causes the a loading symbol to appear. Clicking on the OFF button makes it go away again.
